# SteamFriendsTagger
A simple tool to manually tag steam profiles on your screenshots

The program does not need to be installed and will not change anything on your computer like configurations or registry files.

It also doesn't need steam user's credentials (Username, Password) to access the informations displayed on the interface.

It should display the internal steam IDs for games and user if no internet conection is available. If it can connect to the web it would use Steam API to get more user friendly identification for friends and games name.
